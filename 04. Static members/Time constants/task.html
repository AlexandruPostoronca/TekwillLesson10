<h2>Time constants</h2>
<p></p><p>There are special types of classes called <code>Constants</code> or <code>Utility</code> which have only static fields and/or methods. Usually, such classes cannot be instantiated directly and they are only needed to group related static members to be used by other classes.</p><p>In this exercise, you will work with the <code>TimeConstants</code> class that stores several time constants for seconds. You need to add two static fields <code>SECONDS_IN_DAY</code> and <code>SECONDS_IN_WEEK</code> and print them in this order, each of them on a new line.</p>
