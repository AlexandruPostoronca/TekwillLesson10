<h2>Too many cats</h2>
<p>Let's count cats! Implement a class named <code>Cat</code> and a static method <code>getNumberOfCats</code>.</p>

<p>These are some features of the class:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The class <code>Cat</code> has two instance fields: a string <code>name</code> and an int <code>age</code>, and
        one static int field <code>counter</code>. The static <code>counter</code> field allows you to know how many
        cats have already been created.
    </li>
    <li>The class should have a constructor for initializing the instance fields. During the initialization of a new
        cat, the value of the static field <code>counter</code> should be incremented. If <code>counter &gt; 5</code>,
        the message <strong>"You have too many cats"</strong> must be printed to <code>System.out</code>.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Your static method <code>getNumberOfCats</code> returns the current number of created cats and prints no messages.
</p>

<p><strong>Take a look at the example:</strong></p>

<p>Let's assume seven instances of the class <code>Cat</code> have already been created. Then the correctly implemented
    method <code>Cat.getNumberOfCats()</code> should return <code>7</code>.</p>

<p>Note that the message <code>"You have too many cats"</code> should appear twice: the first time when creating the
    sixth cat and the second time when creating the seventh cat.</p>

<p>Use the provided template and do not make the class private.</p>
