<h2>Patient needs a doctor</h2>
<p>Here's a class named <code>Patient</code>. It has one string field <code>name</code>.</p>

<p>You want to create a method that would allow your patient to call for a doctor. Add the method <code>say</code> that prints the message containing the name of a patient (instead of "...") and their request for a doctor:</p>

<pre><code>Hello, my name is ..., I need a doctor.</code></pre>

<p>This method doesn't take any parameters and doesn't return anything.</p>

<p>Do not make the field and method <code>private</code>.</p>
