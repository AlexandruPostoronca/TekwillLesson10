<h2>Complex numbers</h2>
<p>Jake wants to write a program that works with <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">complex numbers</a>. He created a class <code>Complex</code> that represents a complex number with its real and imaginary parts. Now he needs instance methods so that he can calculate the sum and difference of two complex numbers.</p>

<p>Help Jake and create two instance methods for his class:</p>

<ul>
	<li><code>add(Complex num)</code> that takes another complex number as an argument and adds its corresponding fields to the current instance;</li>
	<li><code>subtract(Complex num)</code> that takes another complex number as an argument and subtracts its corresponding fields from the current instance;</li>
</ul>

<p>Both methods should return nothing.</p>

<p>Do not make the fields and methods <code>private</code>.</p>

<p>Let's consider the example for the <code>add</code> method. If <code>number = 10 + 4i</code> and <code>anotherNumber = 6 + 6i</code>, applying the method <code>add</code> to <code>number</code> with the argument <code>anotherNumber</code> changes number to <code>number = 16 + 10i</code> </p>

<pre><code>Complex number = new Complex();
number.real = 10;
number.image = 4;
// math expression of number = 10.0 + 4.0i

Complex anotherNumber = new Complex();
anotherNumber.real = 6;
anotherNumber.image = 6;
// math expression of anotherNumber = 6.0 + 6.0i

number.add(anotherNumber); // number = 16.0 + 10.0i</code></pre>
