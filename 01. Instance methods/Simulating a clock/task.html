<h2>Simulating a clock</h2>
<p>You are given a class <code>Clock</code>. It has two int fields: <code>hours</code> and <code>minutes</code>. The
    clock has a minute scale from 0 to 59 and an hour scale from 1 to 12. The clock does not know whether it's day or
    night (no AM or PM).</p>

<p>Implement the method <code>next</code> that increases the value of minutes by 1. The minutes must be reset to zero
    when the current hour ends. Do not forget to change the hours as well.</p>

<p>Do not make the fields and methods <code>private</code>.</p>

<p>Let's consider the examples.</p>

<p>1) The initial time of the object <code>clock</code> is 12:00, i.e., <code>hours = 12</code> and <code>minutes =
    0</code>. Applying the <code>next</code> method to the <code>clock</code>, we change its field <code>minutes</code>
    to <code>minutes = 1</code>. In this way, the time is 12:01.</p>

<pre><code>Clock clock = new Clock(); // the time is 12:00
clock.next(); // the time is 12:01</code></pre>

<p>2) The initial time of a <code>clock</code> object is 10:59, i.e. <code>hours = 10</code> and <code>minutes =
    59</code>. After applying the <code>next</code> method to the <code>clock</code>, we turn its fields to <code>hours
    = 11</code> and <code>minutes = 0</code>, i.e., the time is 11:00 now.</p>

<pre><code>Clock clock = new Clock();
clock.hours = 10;
clock.minutes = 59;
// time is 10:59

clock.next(); // the time is 11:00</code></pre>

<p>Here is an example of a clock you are supposed to imitate.</p>
